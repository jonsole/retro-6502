# retro-6502 handoff

Where the project stands and how to carry on. Started on 27 October 2026.

## 1. The project

retro-6502 is retro-z80's machine with a 65C02 in place of the Z80: the same chipset, memory system and board. retro-z80 decided to give it its own repo (retro-z80 design plan, branch 8).

- **Repo:** `jonsole/retro-6502`.
- **Models:** `jonsole/retro-z80` (the chipset, specs, tools and RTL to copy) and `jonsole/retro68k`. Clone both next to this repo.
- **Phase:** 0 (planning). Nothing is built.

## 2. Decided so far

See the design plan, section 1: its own repo, started now, a 65C02, the interrupt controller answering the vector fetch, retro-z80's chipset unchanged.

## 3. Next step

The next branch of the decision tree: the core (Q1), the CPU's memory map (Q2) and BRK against IRQ (Q3). Then spec 1 (bus interface), written from retro-z80's spec 1.
